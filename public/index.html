    <p>If you run an even moderately valuable web site, you&rsquo;re under attack almost
constantly. You&rsquo;ve taken every precaution, properly <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Data_Validation">validating user
input</a>, and contextually escaping everything you write out to
the page. However, your advisaries are clever and numerous, and your time and
attention are limited. You will slip up. A small hole will open. It will be
discovered and exploited. You will be sad. So it goes.</p>

<p>Or does it?</p>

<p>Protecting your site by setting a <strong>Content Security Policy</strong> will add
significant depth to your defenses, mitigating the risk of content injection
attacks by radically reducing their potential effect.</p>

<h2 id="content-securawhat">Content Securawhat?</h2>

<p>The central vulnerability that content-injection attacks rely upon is a
browser&rsquo;s inability to distinguish between content you&rsquo;ve intentionally
included on a site, and content that&rsquo;s been maliciously injected. That is,
<code>&lt;script&gt;doSomethingUseful();&lt;/script&gt;</code> looks exactly the same to a browser as
<code>&lt;script&gt;alert('xss');&lt;/script&gt;</code> when included on a page. Content Security
Policy (CSP) gives you a way to teach the browser about the content you <em>mean</em>
to deliver, allowing it to block everything that doesn&rsquo;t match a simple set of
rules.</p>

<p>These rules are delivered via an especially creatively named HTTP header:
<code>Content-Security-Policy</code>. The policy consists of various directives that
dictate how a certain resource type should be handled, each separated by a
semicolon.  A few examples should make the broad syntax clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SSL Only</strong>: A developer wants to ensure that every page of her site <em>only</em>
loads resources over secure channels. She can enforce this restriction by
setting a policy that says &ldquo;Only render or execute resources that are
delivered over HTTPS.&rdquo; Translated into CSP, that reads:</p>

    <pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https:
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lockdown</strong>: A bank wants to ensure that <em>only</em> resources from its content
delivery network load, and it&rsquo;s quite sure that it only uses JavaScript,
CSS, and images (no plugins, no <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, no web fonts, etc.). It
would like a policy that says &ldquo;Block all resources of all types, except for
images, style, and script loaded from https://cdn.example.com.&rdquo; Translated
to CSP, that reads:</p>

    <pre><code>Content-Security-Policy:
    default-src 'none';
    img-src https://cdn.example.com;
    script-src https://cdn.example.com;
    style-src https://cdn.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
