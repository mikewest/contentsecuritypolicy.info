      <h1>Content Security Policy</h1>
      <h2>Welcome to the post-XSS world</h2>
    </header>

    <p>If you run an even moderately valuable web site, you&#8217;re under attack almost
constantly. You&#8217;ve taken every precaution, properly <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Data_Validation">validating user
input</a>, and contextually escaping everything you write out to
the page. However, your advisaries are clever and numerous, and your time and
attention are limited. You will slip up. A small hole will open. It will be
discovered and exploited. You will be sad. So it goes.</p>

<p>Or does it?</p>

<p>Protecting your site by setting a <strong>Content Security Policy</strong> will add
significant depth to your defenses, mitigating the risk of content injection
attacks by radically reducing their potential effect.</p>

<h2 id="content-securawhat">Content Securawhat?</h2>

<p>The central vulnerability that content-injection attacks rely upon is a
browser&#8217;s inability to distinguish between content you&#8217;ve intentionally
included on a site, and content that&#8217;s been maliciously injected. That is,
<code>&lt;script&gt;doSomethingUseful();&lt;/script&gt;</code> looks exactly the same to a browser as
<code>&lt;script&gt;alert('xss');&lt;/script&gt;</code> when included on a page. Content Security
Policy (CSP) gives you a way to teach the browser about the content you <em>mean</em>
to deliver, allowing it to block everything that doesn&#8217;t match a simple set of
rules.</p>

<p>These rules are delivered via an especially creatively named HTTP header:
<code>Content-Security-Policy</code>. The policy consists of various directives that
dictate how a certain resource type should be handled, each separated by a
semicolon.  A few examples should make the broad syntax clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SSL Only</strong>: A developer wants to ensure that every page of her site <em>only</em>
loads resources over secure channels. She can enforce this restriction by
setting a policy that says &#8220;Only render or execute resources that are
delivered over HTTPS.&#8221; Translated into CSP, that reads:</p>

    <pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https:
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lockdown</strong>: A bank wants to ensure that <em>only</em> resources from its content
delivery network load, and it&#8217;s quite sure that it only uses JavaScript,
CSS, and images (no plugins, no <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, no web fonts, etc.). It
would like a policy that says &#8220;Block all resources of all types, except for
images, style, and script loaded from https://cdn.example.com.&#8221; Translated
to CSP, that reads:</p>

    <pre><code>Content-Security-Policy:
    default-src 'none';
    img-src https://cdn.example.com;
    script-src https://cdn.example.com;
    style-src https://cdn.example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, block inline script by setting a policy that does not
include <code>'unsafe-inline'</code>. This ensures that even if an
attacker finds a hole through which to inject code, she&#8217;ll have a tough
time doing anything useful with it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This will require you to rework some of your own code to move inline event
      handlers and blocks of inline script out into external files. That is,
      you&#8217;ll want to replace this:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;pre data-filename="index.html"&gt;<code>
&lt;script&gt;
  function doStuff() {
    // [AMAZINGNESS GOES HERE]
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
&hellip;
&lt;a href="javascript:doStuff();"&gt;Click me!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;button onclick="doStuff();"&gt;Click me!&lt;/a&gt;
    </code>&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      with this:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;pre data-filename="index.html"&gt;<code>
&lt;script src="index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&hellip;
&lt;a href="javascript:doStuff();" <ins>id="link1"</ins>&gt;Click me!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;button onclick="doStuff();" <ins>id="button1"</ins>&gt;Click me!&lt;/a&gt;
    </code>&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;pre data-filename="index.js"&gt;<code>
function doStuff() {
  // [AMAZINGNESS GOES HERE]
}</code></p>

<p>// Once the document&#8217;s DOM is ready, attach event listeners.
document.addEventListener(&#8216;DOMContentLoaded&#8217;, function () {
  document.querySelector(&#8216;#link1&#8217;).addEventListener(&#8216;click&#8217;, doStuff);
  document.querySelector(&#8216;#button1&#8217;).addEventListener(&#8216;click&#8217;, doStuff);
});</p>
